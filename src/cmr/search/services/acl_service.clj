;;     This code is a point of contention for adding new concepts: on both
;;     occasions where we added varible and service support (e.g. to the
;;     `/search/concepts` route), tests failed with ACL errors due to this ns
;;     not getting updated, both in the function below as well as above in the
;;     `acls-match-concept?` multimethod.
;;
;;     This needs to be taken into account when we plan for refactoring the
;;     APIs and development process for adding concepts to the CMR. The fact
;;     that this crucial change is tucked away in this part of the code with no
;;     logical "pointers" or hints to it anywhere else is deeply problematic ...
;;     programming by conventions is a slow path to developer insanity and
;;     software project failure! Instead, all parts of the code that need to be
;;     touched should be replaced with APIs (e.g., protocols and their impl'ns)
;;     with each method documented and, all together, being the only things a
;;     developer needs to add/change (in this instance) a new concept.
