(ns cmr.search.services.query-execution.has-granules-created-at-feature
  "Supports the has_granules_created_at query parameter for collections. Returns collections
  which have any granules that were created within the time ranges specified by the
  has_granules_created_at time range(s).

  Supporting the feature requires three queries
  1.) Perform a collection query to find only the collections that could potentially match based
  on the collection query parameters ignoring the granule time range.
  2.) Perform a granule search for any granules that match the passed in query parameters and
  collection concept-ids returned in the first query and have a created_at in the
  has_granules_created_at time ranges.
  3.) Return the full search results for those collection-ids returned by the granule query."
